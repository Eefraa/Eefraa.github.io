        <p>1.1    Definition<br>It is necessary here to clarify what a “deep state” exactly is. “Deep state” is a commonly-used concept in political context and yet it is a concept difficult to define precisely.<br>In the Cambridge Dictionary, “deep state” is defined as “organizations such as military, police, or political groups that are said to work secretly in order to protect particular interests and to rule a country without being elected.” On Wikipedia, the term refers to “a type of government made up of potentially secret and unauthorized networks of power operating independently of a state’s political leadership in pursuit of their own agenda and goals (“Deep state,” 2024).” </p>
<p>1.2    Development<br>1.2.1    Origin<br>The term “deep state” is derived from the Turkish word “derin devlet.” In Turkey, the term has been used to describe the “dark forces” that wield significant political influence behind the scenes including elements of the military, the intelligence service, the mafia, and the business elite (Jie, 2022). According to Ryan Gingeras (2019), the Republic of Turkey was established by individuals who had helped form a veritable “state within a state” during the later years of the Ottoman Empire. He claims that Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the country’s founder, was counted among the seminal members of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), which upheld the façade of being an open party committed to parliamentary government and the rule of law, while its members maintained a secret parallel system of control over the country. For some scholars, the CUP era led to the development of a culture of conspiracy and subversion within the ranks of the Turkish state, including the repeated military coups during the 20th century, which are often depicted as a legacy of the CUP’s dependency upon cabals within the Ottoman army to maintain its grip over the empire.<br>Since then, “deep state” has come to be used to refer to a network system composed of individuals from various government departments, closely linked with retired generals and organized crime, yet its existence remains unknown to government officials and senior military leaders (Gao, 2022). The term has been used to describe political phenomena in other countries, such as Thailand, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, etc.</p>
<p>1.2.2    Application in the West<br>In 2009, the first essay that applies the concept of “deep state” to Western countries was published by Norwegian scholar Ola Tunander. In his reading of a wave of terrorist attacks staged by members of the Italian clandestine service during the height of the Cold War, Tunander argues that the “deep state” is in fact one function of the modern “dual state.” As an entity separate from the transparent, officially recognized “democratic” state, the “deep state” historically represented coalitions within the government that work to “veto” or “fine tune” policies related to national security. When elected governments threaten the deep state’s domestic or international interests, actors aligned with this coalition (which Tunander associates with the military, the clandestine service, the mafia, and far-right political activists) employ any means to reverse the state’s political course (Gingeras, 2019).<br>Tunander presented his view of “deep state” before a conference themed “the study of ‘parapolitics and shadow governance’,” held in Melbourne in 2006. One of the attendees was Peter Dale Scott, the best-known scholar who popularized the concept of “deep state” in the United States. In his book The Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire and the Future of America, he mainly charts the history of covert U.S. intervention abroad and how these policies helped give rise to Osama bin Laden. For him, the clandestine actors who helped lay the foundations of al-Qaeda were the same as those who helped drive and engineer U.S. foreign policy since the Cold War (specifically, elements of the U.S. intelligence community, the oil industry and organized crime) (Gingeras, 2019).<br>In 2014, former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren (2014), one of the earliest voices to develop the idea of a “deep state” in the United States, defines the term as “a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.” In his opinion, instead of the entire government, the “deep state” is a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies.<br>Before 2016, in addition to Scott and Lofgren, other researchers or journalists have studied on “deep state” as well. The U.K. newsletter On Religion defines the concept as “the embedded anti-democratic power structures within a government, something very few democracies can claim to be free from (Scott, 2015).” Besides, Dana Priest and William Arkin (2011) raise similar concept, indicating that there are “two governments” in the United States: the one its citizens were familiar with, operated more or less in the open: the other a parallel top secret government whose parts had mushroomed in less than a decade into a gigantic, sprawling universe of its own, visible to only a carefully vetted cadre—and its entirety . . . visible only to God.<br>Additionally, Michael J. Glennon (2016) applies the “double government” theory of 19th-century scholar of the English Constitution Walter Bagehot to the United States, discussing similar concept to the “deep state”. He argues that U.S. national security policy is defined by the network of executive officials who manage the departments and agencies responsible for protecting U.S. national security and who, responding to structural incentives embedded in the U.S. political system, operate largely removed from public view and from constitutional constraints. The network includes several hundred high-level military, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement officials within the Executive Branch. </p>
<p>1.2.3    Use during the Trump Era<br>Since Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2016, the concept of the “deep state” began to widely spread in the United States (Gao, 2022). On December 16, 2016, an anonymous author, writing under the pseudonym “Virgil,” published a 4,000-word article in Breitbart News, then under the leadership of Steve Bannon. Entitled “The Deep State vs. Donald Trump,” the piece introduced the term “deep state” to a broader conservative audience. Virgil claims that the “deep state” stretches across the whole of the federal government, and even the entirety of the country. And it includes not only bureaucrats, but also a galaxy of contractors, profiteers, and others in the nominal private sector. And it includes not only Democrats, but also Republicans. And oh yes, the MSM and the chattering class (Virgil, 2016).<br>“Deep state” was rapidly popularized among the American people around the time Trump entered office. In a search of TV transcripts, the term “deep state” appeared only 64 times in 2016, the year Lofgren published his book. However, in 2017, it shot up to nearly 2,300 mentions, and surged to nearly 5,000 hits last year, many of them on Fox News (Myre &amp; Treisman, 2019). People’s views on the term have changed a lot as well. In a 2018 Monmouth University poll, 74% of Americans said they believed that “a group of unelected government and military officials are secretly manipulating or directing national policy.” According to a 2019 YouGov poll, nearly all those Republicans who have heard of the “deep state” believe it is trying to overthrow President Trump, while only 10% Democrats think so (Frankovic, 2019).</p>
<p>1.3    Opinions<br>After Donald Trump took office in 2017, people interpret and discuss the concept of the term based on their own political stances. On the one hand, Alex Newman (2018) agrees with the definition of Lofgren, but considers the term “deeper than he seems to realize.” According to a definition provided by Newman, much of what has been referred to as the “deep state” is “merely part of the government — the legions of entrenched Big Government bureaucrats and especially the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and other secretive agencies.” He argues that there is a “deep state” behind the deep state, which “wields tremendous power over America and the world.” Besides, Greg Grandin (2017) summarizes the usage of “deep state,” and claims three overlapping understandings on the term: 1) relates to war, militarism, and intelligence, the secret institutions that have deep roots but were fused together in a powerful way under the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama; 2) private corporate power, especially associated with finance, the arms trade, and fossil fuels; 3) the many embedded bureaucrats of the US government’s many administrative agencies, who are leading a passive resistance to Trump’s program of privatization and deregulation. In addition, Jack Goldsmith (2018) defines the term as “national security bureaucrats who use secretly collected information to shape or curb the actions of elected officials.”<br>On the other hand, Jon D. Michaels (2017) claims that “deep state has little relevance to the United States, where governmental power structures are almost entirely transparent, egalitarian, and rule-bound.” Mentioning Trump’s definition of the term, “a conspiracy of powerful, unelected bureaucrats secretly pursuing their own agenda,” Micheals gives his objections on Trump’s understanding, “It (the American state) is not secretive, exclusive, and monolithic, but open, diverse, and fragmented. Its purpose is not to pursue a private agenda contrary to the public will but to execute that will-to deliver to the people the goods and services that their elected representatives have decreed, and to do so fairly and effectively (Michaels, 2017).” Additionally, Amanda Taub and Max Fisher (2017) consider the “deep state” as “a political conflict between a nation’s leader and its governing institutions instead of a shadowy conspiracy.” In the context of multiple leaks that Trump experienced in 2017, Taub and Fisher suggest that leaks can be a normal and healthy check on a president’s power, an emergency brake on policies that officials believe could be ill-advised or unlawful. Some push and pull between a president and his or her agencies is normal. However, apparently, Trump was seeking to cut the intelligence community, State Department, and other agencies out of the policy-making process almost entirely, which may have led to an entrenched culture of conflict between the president and his own bureaucracy. Besides, Emma Ashford (2018) denies the Trump’s repeated assertions that a deep state exists, and that it is actively thwarting his policy agenda, pushing investigations into his campaign or even wiretapping his offices. She agrees that there will always be pressure on foreign policy from entrenched interest groups, both inside and outside the government. However, she argues that the idea that the whole American bureaucracy shares a common goal on practically any issue area simply doesn’t pass muster. When discussing the consistency of U.S. foreign policy, she agrees with Glennon’s opinion that there has been remarkable consistency over time in U.S. foreign policy. Yet instead of taking some unelected network of bureaucrats (the so-called “double government” or the “deep state”) as the cause of this consistency, Ashford claims that it is the bipartisan foreign-policy consensus that has guided American policy since the end of the Cold War.<br>Domestically, Fu Suixin (2017) refers the term “deep state” to government agencies responsible for national security (including the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice, particularly intelligence agencies such as the CIA, the NSA, and the FBI) at the core, as well as non-governmental departments related to national security (especially the large number of intelligence and defense contractors near Washington’s Beltway) on the periphery, and Wall Street has always been involved. Besides, Zhang Zhixin (2019) describes the usage of the term during the Trump administration as “a loosely organized anti-Trump network, which includes both the Establishment within the government and anti-Trump forces outside the system.” In addition, based on a review of different definitions given by other scholars, Gao Hailong (2022) defines the “deep state” as “federal government agencies, such as the U.S. national security sector, and the federal bureaucrats serving within these agencies.” While on the other hand, Zhao Min (2023) defines the term from a different perspective. He summarizes various viewpoints and uses four types of narratives to categorize the American “deep state”—capital narrative, refers to giant enterprises and multinational corporations in industries such as manufacturing, commerce, finance, emerging technology, and military industry, with big capital (large corporations and conglomerates) at the core, and military generals, senior officials, and members of Congress who serve as agents or partners in senior leadership positions; political narrative, refers to departments related to national security under the Establishment (the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the CIA); governmental narrative, refers to career civil servants across the federal government; and conspiracy narrative, refers to peripheral think tanks and advisors that provide reports, policy briefs, and specific policy recommendations to the political leadership, and certain special think tanks, secretive organizations, or even some influential families.</p>

<li>   Government Bureaucracy in the United States</li>
</ol>
<p>After a literature review on the term “deep state”, it can be concluded that there is a consensus that government bureaucracy is a part of the “deep state.” The vast majority of the officials within federal government are unelected, and their personal political views regularly conflict with those of elected officials. The main disagreement lies in the role that career civil servants play. On the one hand, some see these American bureaucrats as a vital check on the law-breaking or authoritarian or otherwise illegitimate tendencies of democratically elected officials. According to Rohde (2020), career civil servants implement the policies of elected officials, regardless of party. In private, they warn elected officials of the potential pitfalls of a proposed policy, whether it has been attempted in the past, and if it violates existing laws. They contend that a healthy tension exists between elected officials who often rush to implement policies and civil servants who often prefer caution. The result, they argue, is better policies. Some experts argue that career civil servants, like the press, represent an additional “check and balance” that helps prevent abuses by the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Heidi Kitrosser (2018) argues that pockets of political independence among agency employees not only are compatible with, but also are necessary to ensure political and legal accountability within and outside of an agency, and thus need to be protected. On the other hand, others decry national security bureaucrats as a self-serving authoritarian cabal that illegally and illegitimately undermines democratically elected officials and the policies they were elected to implement. Unelected officials who refuse to implement the orders of an elected president are a threat to American democracy. The FBI and CIA are enormously powerful organizations that have long and sordid histories of abusing the civil rights of Americans. Controlling spy and law enforcement agencies is one of the greatest challenges that the United States and other democracies face in the digital age (Rohde, 2020).<br>American bureaucratic system can be seen as a constraint to the power of the President. Although career civil servants play the role of implementing the policies, their responsibilities are not solely to their superiors or the President, but also to the Constitution, laws, and their professional standards. Therefore, sometimes they may resist orders from their superiors. The Trump administration has witnessed unprecedentedly high tension between the career civil servants and the President. Numerous leaks against Trump were made by intelligence officials. The hard questions are whether these leaks are virtuous or abusive and what the consequences of these actions are. According to Jack Goldsmith (2018), the leaks were “unlawful and, beyond that, they violated two until-now strict taboos about leaks – first on revealing the content of foreign intelligence information collected through electronic surveillance, and second on revealing the content of incidentally collected information about American citizens.”</p>

<li>   In Deep</li>
</ol>
<p>3.1    Summary<br>In his book In Deep, David Rohde (2020) tries to answer the question of whether a “deep state” exists in the United States. He claims that “To conservatives, the ‘deep state’ is an ever-growing government bureaucracy, an administrative state that they think relentlessly encroaches on the individual rights of Americans and whose highest loyalty is to its own preservation and power. Liberals are less apt to use the term ‘deep state,’ but they fear the ‘military-industrial complex’—a cabal of generals and defense contractors who they believe routinely push the country into endless wars, operate a vast surveillance state, and enrich themselves in the process.”<br>The book is separated into two parts. Part 1 chronicles the CIA and FBI scandals of the past forty years—from the Church Committee’s exposure of Cold War abuses, to Iran-Contra, to false intelligence about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, to the NSA mass surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden. It also examines the bitter power struggles that have unfolded between presidents and Congress, from Ford to Obama. Part 2 of the book investigates the claims and counterclaims of the Trump era, and the relentless spread of conspiracy theories online and on air. </p>
<p>3.2    Research Significance<br>The debate surrounding the term “deep state” raises central questions about American democracy. The balance between government bureaucracy and presidents exerts direct impacts on the effectiveness of the U.S. political system.<br>Consistent efforts in limiting the power of government bureaucracy can be seen from Ford to Obama. The power of intelligence agencies such as the FBI and the CIA have either grown or limited significantly across different periods, which impacted American domestic and foreign policies. The book discusses the causes and effects of the change in the power of the FBI and the CIA. It analyzes certain events such as the 9/11 from the perspective of domestic political system. U.S. intelligence agencies were aware of al-Qaeda’s growing threat in the years leading up to 9/11, but failures in interagency communication, as well as an underestimation of the group’s capabilities, contributed to the inability to prevent the attacks. The past failures on properly limiting the power of intelligence agencies provide references to future U.S. policymaking.<br>When it came to Trump era, debates on whether a “deep state” exists in the United States have reflected people’s untrust in the government. Studies on the tension between government bureaucracy and presidents provide a new perspective to view the U.S. politics. As the “fourth branch” of the U.S. government, government bureaucracy can maintain influence and continuity across different administrations. On the one hand, policies and actions may remain consistent despite changes in leadership; on the other hand, unelected officials who refuse to implement the orders of an elected president are a threat to American democracy. Research into the term “deep state” helps evaluate the effectiveness of checks and balances within the U.S. government. It examines how the judiciary, legislative, and executive branches interact with or attempt to control non-elected officials and government agencies. Understanding these dynamics is important for determining the balance between national security needs and democratic oversight.<br>Clarifying the concept of “deep state” is crucial for understanding the U.S. politics especially during the Trump era. Amid Trump’s presidential campaign in 2024, studying the definition of “deep state” and its usage in new circumstances provides insights about Trump’s new political opinions and the potential development trend of the United States.</p>
